# Technical Assessment Project

This program demonstrates a simple discount calculation for given criterias according to Orders and Users. 
 The criterias are;
 On a retail website, the following discounts apply: 
-  If the user is an employee of the store, he gets a 30% discount 
-  If the user is an affiliate of the store, he gets a 10% discount 
-  If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, he gets a 5% discount. 
-  For every $100 on the bill, there would be a $ 5 discount (e.g. for $ 990, you get $ 45 as a discount). 
-  The percentage based discounts do not apply on groceries. 
-  A user can get only one of the percentage based discounts on a bill. 

- Please note that the program does not have a user interface.

## Getting Started

You can just download the project and run the test. Sample console methods are defined at main class, if you would like to take a look.

### Prerequisites

Since this is a Java program, Java SDK (at least Java 8) is required. Also, `gradle` must be installed, if you do not have a gradle integrated IDE like `IntelliJ IDEA`.


### Installing

Since the project manages dependencies via gradle, you can directly build and run the project, once you download it.

## Running the tests

Detailed test scenarios are already written. You can run the defined tests directly.
